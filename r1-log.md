The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 9, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Built out html and css code to match my Figma wireframe. Started to set up javascript, troubleshooting the Marvel API!

### R1D2
Switched to using the superhero api and successfully displayed the character info on the card for the searched superhero/villain name! Also added some more styling.

### R1D3
focusing was hard today if iâ€™m honest. but, i did 25 lessons on freeCodeCamp and then coded the character card functionality for my Marvel project! Tomorrow: finishing css, readme, deploying w/ Netlify, & practicing my presentation

### R1D4
Finished my project! I added mobile responsiveness, the random character generator functionality, and final styling. I also finished my README and deployed onto Netlify!

### R1D5
Not too much coding done since it was presentation day at General Assembly! I did some final touches on my project and debugged a couple small things. One last detail - figuring out how to link back to my home page from the credits w Netlify.

### R1D6
I dove into backend development! Learned express basics and practiced setting up an express server, GET routes, and using query params.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished lesson 10 in Shay Howe's intro to HTML & CSS course on building and styling HTML forms and coded the registration page for Styles Conference website. I also practiced by building FCC's registration form project.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding consistently after being inconsistent and not making progress for years so I'm really enjoying how concepts are clicking so much easier, I barely needed to look at the instructions to know what code needed to be added for both projects

### Day 2: March 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started this log today and filled in yesterday's details. Today I worked through Shayhowe Lesson 11, not completed yet but got about halfway done with the Schedule page! I also added a repo for my Styles Conference site to show my progress. I also completed The Odin Projects Javascript Fundamentals Pt. 1 lesson and messed with variables, Numbers, and operators in the console. 

**Thoughts** I didn't get much project coding done today but learned a lot and am happy that I should finish up Shay Howe reading tomorrow or Friday. I am already familiar with Javascript fundamentals from my job teaching kids how to code so it's making Javascript a lot easier to pick up.

### Day 3: March 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML & CSS course! Added the last HTML and CSS code for the Styles Conference website. This included applying final styling and organization to the table on the Schedule page. Wrapped up the course by learning some best practices when writing HTML & CSS code, which had been applied throughout the Styles Conference project as well. I also finished Javascript Fundamentals Pt. 2 and half of the Javascript Dev Tools lessons in TOP's curriculum. I reinstilled my knowledge and learned a few new things about data types, conditionals, comparison and logical operators, and the capabilities of dev tools in the browser. 

**Thoughts** I learned a lot and gained more confidence in my Javascript understanding today. Focus also came easy and I never felt frustrated or too confused while I was working. Overall, best day so far!

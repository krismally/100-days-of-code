# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished lesson 10 in Shay Howe's intro to HTML & CSS course on building and styling HTML forms and coded the registration page for Styles Conference website. I also practiced by building FCC's registration form project.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding consistently after being inconsistent and not making progress for years so I'm really enjoying how concepts are clicking so much easier, I barely needed to look at the instructions to know what code needed to be added for both projects

### Day 2: March 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started this log today and filled in yesterday's details. Today I worked through Shayhowe Lesson 11, not completed yet but got about halfway done with the Schedule page! I also added a repo for my Styles Conference site to show my progress. I also completed The Odin Projects Javascript Fundamental Pt. 1 lesson and messed with variables, Numbers, and operators in the console. 

**Thoughts** I didn't get much project coding done today but learned a lot and am happy that I should finish up Shay Howe reading tomorrow or Friday. I am already familiar with Javascript fundamentals from my job teaching kids how to code so it's making Javascript a lot easier to pick up.

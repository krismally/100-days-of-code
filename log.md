# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished lesson 10 in Shay Howe's intro to HTML & CSS course on building and styling HTML forms and coded the registration page for Styles Conference website. I also practiced by building FCC's registration form project.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding consistently after being inconsistent and not making progress for years so I'm really enjoying how concepts are clicking so much easier, I barely needed to look at the instructions to know what code needed to be added for both projects

### Day 2: March 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started this log today and filled in yesterday's details. Today I worked through Shayhowe Lesson 11, not completed yet but got about halfway done with the Schedule page! I also added a repo for my Styles Conference site to show my progress. I also completed The Odin Projects Javascript Fundamentals Pt. 1 lesson and messed with variables, Numbers, and operators in the console. 

**Thoughts** I didn't get much project coding done today but learned a lot and am happy that I should finish up Shay Howe reading tomorrow or Friday. I am already familiar with Javascript fundamentals from my job teaching kids how to code so it's making Javascript a lot easier to pick up.

### Day 3: March 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML & CSS course! Added the last HTML and CSS code for the Styles Conference website. This included applying final styling and organization to the table on the Schedule page. Wrapped up the course by learning some best practices when writing HTML & CSS code, which had been applied throughout the Styles Conference project as well. I also finished Javascript Fundamentals Pt. 2 and half of the Javascript Dev Tools lessons in TOP's curriculum. I reinstilled my knowledge and learned a few new things about data types, conditionals, comparison and logical operators, and the capabilities of dev tools in the browser. 

**Thoughts** I learned a lot and gained more confidence in my Javascript understanding today. Focus also came easy and I never felt frustrated or too confused while I was working. Overall, best day so far!

### Day 4: March 11, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for the April 4 Chingu Voyage! Spent time looking through Tier 1 Solo Projects, researching other people's experience, and introducing myself in the Chingu Discord. Finished the Javascript Dev Tools lesson today! Took a while to get through (three 25 min pomodoro sessions) since I followed along with each exercise in my browser.

**Thoughts** I didn't get much sleep so my productivity dipped quickly today. I did enjoy learning new capabilities of Chrome's Dev Tools and am very excited to start my Chingu Solo Project. Unexpected personal life things hit me hard in the afternoon and then I had a shift at my part-time kid's coding instructor job so I didn't code after about 2pm.

### Day 5: March 12, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: I had a coffee chat with a Senior Web Developer and summarized the experience on Twitter and LinkedIn. I also watched a few YouTube videos on building a tech resume, accessibility in code, and startups. Then, I chose my Solo Project for Chingu. Not much actual code done today due to mental and physical health. 

**Thoughts** Today was hard. I started the day feeling mentally and physically awful and it ended up getting worse as the day went on. I did still get some helpful things done, just couldn't be at my desk much.

### Day null: March 13, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Missed coding work today. Met with my startup partner to define MVP requirements list and discuss next-steps. Then researched Project Management tools and started migrating our workflow to Notion. 

**Thoughts** Too busy with non-coding startup work and focusing on recovering from a draining past couple days

### Day 6: March 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on TOP JS today! Started fundamentals Pt. 3 and learned basics of Functions. I finished: read MDN's Functions guide and Return Values guide, all practice for the Functions guide, started the function-library.html practice for the Return Values guide.

**Thoughts** Not as productive as I wanted but ended up full planning out a time management system which was a major necessity for succesfully continuing this challenge! Overall: satisfied with the day.

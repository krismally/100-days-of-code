# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished lesson 10 in Shay Howe's intro to HTML & CSS course on building and styling HTML forms and coded the registration page for Styles Conference website. I also practiced by building FCC's registration form project.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding consistently after being inconsistent and not making progress for years so I'm really enjoying how concepts are clicking so much easier, I barely needed to look at the instructions to know what code needed to be added for both projects
